## Footnotes from data source:

1 Populations are U.S. Census Bureau provisional estimates as of July 1 for each year except 2000 and 2010, which are decennial census counts.
2 The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were estimated using the legacy Uniform Crime Reporting definition of rape.  See data declaration for further explanation.
3 The murder and nonnegligent homicides that occurred as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, are not included in this table.
4 The crime figures have been adjusted.
NOTE:  Although arson data are included in the trend and clearance tables, sufficient data are not available to estimate totals for this offense.  Therefore, no arson data are published in this table.
